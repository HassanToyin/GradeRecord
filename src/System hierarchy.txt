Linux hierarchy is a standardized directory structure used by Linux systems to organize and manage files and directories.

There are severe directories in linux file system hierarchy

1. / (Root):

   Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy.

   Every single file and directory start from the root directory.
   The only root user has the right to write under this directory.
   /root is the root user’s home directory, which is not the same as /

2. /bin :
Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp.

Contains binary executables.
Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
Commands used by all the users of the system are located here e.g. ps, ls, ping, grep, cp

3. /boot :
 Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd.
 Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
 Example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic

4. /dev :
 Essential device files, e.g., /dev/null.
These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
Example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

5. /etc :
 Host-specific system-wide configuration files.

Contains configuration files required by all programs.
This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
Example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf.

6. /home :
 Users’ home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.

Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
example: /home/kishlay, /home/kv

7. /lib:
 Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.

Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
Example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7

8. /media:
 Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3).

Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
Examples, /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cdrecorder for CD writer

9. /mnt :
 Temporarily mounted filesystems.

Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.

10. /opt :
Optional application software packages.

Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
Add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.

11. /sbin :
Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route.

Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
The linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system administrators, for system maintenance purposes.
Example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon
